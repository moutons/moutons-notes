moutons-notes
=============

This contains various notes that I have found helpful to have around at one time or another. Undoubtedly other copies exist, but adding them here seems like a reasonable step to take so I am taking it.

If they are helpful to you, feel free to fork the repo. If you issue a pull request, please document your contributions in some reasonable manner.

I'm a reasonable fellow and will be more than happy to leave unobtrusive attributions in place. *It's too bad gollum doesn't support [MultiMarkdown] [1].* Then you could use footnotes, subscript/superscript, et cetera.
